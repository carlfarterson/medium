## I was stood up by a 41-year-old on a date. I’m 25.

Why are so many people confined by social standards? Like it or not, unspoken conventions
define most of our lives without us ever realizing it. Conventions dictate our actions,
turning what we think is a “choice” into a pre-determined outcome, pre-determined
because we have been trained to respond in a way that feels unique, and yet our
response is anything but unique.

The most common social assumption I’ve seen has to do with age. You hear it in the
phrase “Ok, boomer”, which is essentially a condescending tone from Millennials
and Gen-Zers towards Baby Boomers’ often outdated and out-of-touch perspective towards
modern issues. You also see it in assumptions from Baby Boomers that Millennials
are lazy and entitled.

It’s easy to see the discrepancy in these instances because of how glaring the age
gap really is. Baby Boomers are people born from 1944–1964 and Gen Z are from 1995–2015,
meaning these two age groups are at least 31 years apart. A lot can happen in 31
years.

However, I’d argue there’s even an stronger age-discrimination case that runs a
lot shorter than 31 years, hell, even shorter than 10 years in some cases. I have
personally experienced age-biased assumptions in both my professional and personal
life, and let me tell you, these assumptions are like a glass ceiling on my daily
life, and in response to assumptions, I’ve noticed that I act more like the assumptions
placed on me. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I knew my age would be an issue from the start. “Are you okay with 41?” and “I hope
not sugar momma” were among her first couple messages. A couple messages later and
I’m looking at “you seem to be more mature for your age” and “you look so young”.
All of these comments by a woman I have never met. Anyway, we ended up scheduling
a coffee date, and on the day of I text her only to hear she can’t make it because,
“something else came came up.”

I wish I could say this was the first time something like this happened. Unfortunately,
this experience has been all too common in my pursuit of an older woman and I don’t
see it stopping any time soon.

Part of the problem stems from the positive and negative biases everyone develops
towards others based on their experience. After all, everyone sees the world through
a different lens crafted by the events they’ve been a part of and the habits they
see on a daily basis, influenced by the people they interact with most. The influence
others exert on our judgment can be stronger than our own judgement.

What really prevented mystery woman from coming? Outside of the age remarks we had
a great text conversation with a range of topics with similar interests. I believe
her decision was made based on the social pressure she would get from her friends
had they known she was talking to someone 16 years younger than her and 6 years
older than her son. The remarks she made to me of “you look so young” would surely
be repeated by her friends, followed by many more age-related comments.

We need to be wary of our friend’s opinions and take them at face value. They truly
mean the best for us and think their opinions help, when in reality they may be
limiting us from our true potential. If you’re 41 and you want to date a 25 year
old, date a 25 year old. In the end the only opinion you care about should be your
own, and if your friends want to give you a hard time for a decision you make, smile
back with satisfaction of knowing they’re offering their unique lens of experience,
and it should be taken as such.
