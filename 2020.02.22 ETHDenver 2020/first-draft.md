#### Overview
ETHDenver is without a doubt one of the best recurring Ethereum events to attend.  So many people from so many different walks of life come together with the shared purpose of applying decentralization to bleeding-edge technology, and this year was no exception.  At ETHDenver 2020 I met people with a wide range of experience around crypto, from the trading enthusiasts like Ben and Tyler to the seasoned crypto vets like Sunny and Hannah.


#### Key Takeaways from ETHDenver 2020
A second year of ETHDenver under my belt means a more pragmatic approach to viewing the impact of ETHDenver.  ETHDenver 2019 sucked me into the world of dApps and a feeling that decentralization is akin to Utopianism, where the more decentralization we have, the more utopian our society will be.  However, I've realized this is not the way the world works, and instead of replacing a distopian, centralized world, decentralization should be used as a supplement to the systems we have in place.

Following that aside, these were my pain perceptions from ETHDenver 2020:
- Attending for a second year was even more exciting than the first year, for the fact of re-meeting people I met last year, as well as meeting people I've talked to online for months but have never met in person.

- It's fascinating to see all the cultures, habits, and personalities from around the world meet for the same cause.

- I really liked how ETHDenver separated presentations based on their technicality/complexity.  Everyone that attended ETHDenver has their own unique perspective of crypto, which can lead to disjointed conversations and comprehension gaps.  Providing speakers to talk about core decentralization tenets help keep the newbies involved, and providing live-coding sessions help keep the Web3 developers involved.


#### What would make for a better ETHDenver 2021?
- During BUIDL week before ETHDenver, __more guided meetings that connect solo devs to teams__.  I met countless new, solo devs that weren't able to hack because they weren't able to find a team in time.

- __Hackathon bounties need to be organized by topic, not company offering the bounty__.  I had to manually comb through ETHDenver sponsors to see which companies have a purpose similar to my hackathon project, then research the bounties specific to that sponsor.  I feel like the bounty information wasn't communicated well enough.

- Meeting others at ETHDenver... Is there an app for that?  Floors 4 and 5 had plenty of open space to facilitate a communal meeting area.  This could further improve relationship building during ETHDenver and lead to discussions that are less small talk and more purpose driven.

- Shared schedules to help with travel.  This could be for Denver and Breck.  So many people had similar travel times but had trouble communicating, leading to more time and money spent on solo-travel, which could be spent focusing on BUIDLing.  Perhaps a __shared Google Calendar__ where participants could add their flight date/time information?

- __RSVP's for the bus to Breck should be staked__.  I ended up on the waitlist and had to find alternative travel to Breck, only to find out there was plenty of extra space on the bus.  Providing a stake should provide a more accurate number on who plans to show up.


### Conclusion
I'm extremely fortunate and grateful to have attended ETHDenver for two years in a row.  Each time I've gone had had an even better time than I imagined.  This year was no exception.
