## ETHDenver 2020 Reflections

#### Introduction
[ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com) is without a doubt one of the best recurring Ethereum events to attend.  So many people from so many different walks of life come together with the shared purpose of applying decentralization to bleeding-edge technology.  At ETHDenver 2020 I met people with a wide range of experience in crypto, from the trading enthusiasts like Ben and Tyler to the seasoned crypto vets like Sunny and Hannah.


#### ETHDenver 2020 - Key Takeaways
A second year of ETHDenver under my belt means a more holistic approach in viewing the overall purpose and results of ETHDenver.  ETHDenver 2019 pulled me into the world of [dApps](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps/) and gave me the feeling that decentralization is analogous to Utopianism in which increased decentralization means a more utopian society.  However, I've realized that the `decentralization == utopia` is a naive perspective which doesn't account for the systems, cultural norms, and practices already built around centralized organizations.
