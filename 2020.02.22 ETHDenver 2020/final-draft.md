## ETHDenver 2020 Reflections
### Carter Carlson


#### Introduction
[ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com) is without a doubt one of the best recurring Ethereum events to attend.  So many people from so many different walks of life come together with the shared purpose of applying decentralization to bleeding-edge technology.  At ETHDenver 2020 I met people with a wide range of experience in crypto, from the trading enthusiasts like Ben and Tyler to the seasoned crypto vets like Sunny and Hannah.

A second year of ETHDenver under my belt means a more holistic approach in viewing the overall purpose and results of ETHDenver.  ETHDenver 2019 pulled me into the world of [dApps](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/dapps/) and gave me the feeling that decentralization is analogous to Utopianism in which increased decentralization means a more utopian society.  However, I've realized that the `decentralization == utopia` is a naive perspective which doesn't account for the systems, cultural norms, and practices already built around centralized organizations.


#### ETHDenver 2020 - 2 key takeaways
- Attending for a second year was even more exciting than my first year.  I was able to catch up with people I had met last year and meet people I've talked to online for months but have never met in person.

- I like how ETHDenver groups presentations based on their technicality/complexity.  Everyone that attends ETHDenver has their own unique experience of crypto, which can lead to disjointed conversations and comprehension gaps.  Providing speakers to talk about core decentralization concepts help keep the newbies involved, and providing live-coding sessions help keep the Web3 developers involved.


#### ETHDenver 2021 - What could make it better?
- During BUIDL week, __more guided meetings that connect solo devs to teams__.  I met countless new, solo devs that weren't able to hack because they weren't able to find a team in time.

- __Hackathon bounties need to be organized by topic, not company offering the bounty__.  I had to manually comb through ETHDenver sponsors to see which companies have a purpose similar to my hackathon project, then research the bounties specific to that sponsor.  I feel like the bounty information wasn't communicated well enough.

- __RSVPs for the bus to Breckenridge should be staked__.  I ended up on the waitlist and had to find alternative travel to Breckenridge, only to find out there was plenty of extra space on the bus.  Providing a stake should provide a more accurate number on who plans to show up.

### Conclusion
I'm extremely fortunate and grateful to have attended ETHDenver for two years in a row.  Each time I've gone had had an even better time than I imagined.  This year was no exception.
